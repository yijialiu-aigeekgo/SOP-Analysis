Thank you for sharing this detailed missing tasks analysis for patients Dehui and Dane. This is a comprehensive breakdown showing significant gaps in standard operating procedures across multiple roles (Front Desk, MA, CA/CM).

## Key Observations:

**Most Critical Gaps:**
- **Patient identification verification** - missing for both patients at multiple touchpoints
- **Complete medication reconciliation** - partially done but missing adherence and side effect assessments
- **UC program enrollment** - completely missing for Dane despite apparent eligibility
- **Patient education delivery** - not performed for Dehui

**Systemic Issues:**
- Front desk processes incomplete (insurance verification, co-pay collection)
- Documentation gaps in EHR and portals
- Missing quality checks (abnormal value flagging, equipment sanitization)
- Incomplete care coordination between roles

**Questions for Next Steps:**
1. Are there specific barriers preventing completion of these tasks (time, training, system issues)?
2. Which missing tasks pose the highest clinical risk?
3. What's the priority order for addressing these gaps?
4. Are there workflow or staffing adjustments needed to ensure completion?

Would you like me to help prioritize these missing tasks by clinical importance or suggest an implementation plan to address the gaps?
