# KPI Performance Analysis - Patient Visit Workflow

## Executive Summary
Analysis of two patient visits reveals workflow adherence with notable extra tasks performed, particularly comprehensive data collection activities that enhance patient care but extend beyond standard SOP requirements.

## Key Performance Indicators

### 1. SOP Compliance Rate
**P1 (Dehui):** 100% - All tasks aligned with SOP
**P2 (Dane):** 75% - 3 of 4 staff-performed activities included extra tasks

### 2. Workflow Efficiency Metrics

| Patient | Check-In Duration | Pre-Provider Duration | Extra Tasks | Wait Time |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| P1 | 2 min | 3 min | 0 | 6 min |
| P2 | 24 min | 18 min | 4 | 22 min |

### 3. Role-Based Task Distribution

**Medical Assistant (MA):**
- Standard Tasks Completed: 7
- Extra Tasks Performed: 2
- Efficiency Impact: Extended pre-provider workflow by ~10 minutes for comprehensive history

**Care Coordinator/Case Manager (CA/CM):**
- Standard Tasks: 1
- Extra Tasks: 1 (UC Program Screening)
- Value-Add: Proactive patient engagement for program enrollment

### 4. Critical Performance Observations

**Strengths:**
- 100% completion of required vital signs collection
- Proactive medication reconciliation for new patients
- Enhanced data collection supporting comprehensive care

**Opportunities:**
- Standardize social history collection depth to balance thoroughness with efficiency
- Formalize EKG protocols for DM/HTN patients
- Establish guidelines for UC program screening timing

### 5. Time Utilization Analysis

**P1 Total Visit Time:** 9 minutes (excluding wait)
- Optimal workflow execution for follow-up visit

**P2 Total Visit Time:** 42 minutes (excluding wait)
- Extended due to new patient status and comprehensive intake
- Extra tasks added ~15 minutes to standard workflow

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Enhanced Protocols:** Formalize comprehensive history and EKG as standard for new DM/HTN patients
2. **Optimize Wait Times:** P2's 22-minute wait suggests scheduling or staffing optimization needed
3. **Training Focus:** Ensure consistent understanding of essential vs. optional data collection
4. **Resource Allocation:** Consider dedicated UC screening time slots to prevent workflow disruption

## Conclusion
While extra tasks demonstrate thorough patient care commitment, standardizing these practices and optimizing time allocation will improve both care quality and operational efficiency.
