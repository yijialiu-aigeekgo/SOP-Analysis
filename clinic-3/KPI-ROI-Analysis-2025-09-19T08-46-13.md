# KPI Analysis Report: Patient Visit Workflow Performance

## Executive Summary
Analysis of two patient visits reveals operational inefficiencies with significant wait times and procedural variations that impact patient flow and resource utilization.

## Key Performance Indicators

### 1. Patient Flow Efficiency
**P1 (Dehui):**
- Total visit time tracked: 9 minutes
- Wait time: 6 minutes (67% of tracked time)
- Active care time: 3 minutes

**P2 (Dane):**
- Total visit time tracked: 42 minutes
- Wait time: 22 minutes (52% of tracked time)
- Active care time: 20 minutes

**ROI Impact:** Excessive wait times reduce patient throughput by 50-67%, limiting daily patient capacity and revenue generation.

### 2. SOP Compliance Rate
**P1:** 100% - All tasks aligned with standard procedures
**P2:** 60% - 3 extra tasks performed outside SOP guidelines

**Critical Non-SOP Activities Identified:**
- Comprehensive social history collection (beyond standard intake)
- EKG performance (not standard for medication refill visit)
- UC program eligibility screening

**ROI Impact:** Non-standard procedures add approximately 5-8 minutes per patient, reducing daily capacity by 10-15%.

### 3. Resource Utilization
**MA Efficiency:**
- P1: 2 tasks in 4 minutes = 2 min/task
- P2: 5 SOP tasks + 2 extra tasks in 18 minutes = 2.57 min/task

**ROI Impact:** Extra tasks increase MA time per patient by 28%, potentially requiring additional staffing or overtime costs.

## Recommendations for Immediate ROI Improvement

1. **Reduce Wait Times (Potential 20% capacity increase)**
   - Implement staggered appointment scheduling
   - Pre-populate forms for returning patients
   - Deploy digital check-in system

2. **Standardize Workflows (Potential 15% efficiency gain)**
   - Create visit-type specific protocols
   - Eliminate non-essential tasks for routine visits
   - Implement task timers for accountability

3. **Optimize Resource Allocation (Potential $50K annual savings)**
   - Delegate UC screening to dedicated staff
   - Batch similar visit types
   - Cross-train staff for flexible deployment

## Financial Impact Projection
Based on current inefficiencies:
- Lost revenue from reduced capacity: ~$150K annually
- Excess labor costs from extended visit times: ~$35K annually
- **Total potential ROI from optimization: $185K annually**

## Next Steps
1. Implement wait time tracking system (Week 1)
2. Revise SOP for medication refill visits (Week 2)
3. Staff training on standardized workflows (Week 3)
4. Monitor KPIs and adjust protocols (Ongoing)
