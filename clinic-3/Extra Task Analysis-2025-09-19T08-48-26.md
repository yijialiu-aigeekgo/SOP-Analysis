# Scenario-Based Extra Tasks Analysis

## Scenario Patient Distribution

### UC Enrollment (1 patient)
- **P2 Dane** (Clinic's new patient; iHealth new patient) - DM/HTN | Reason for visit: refill med | Appt: 3:00

### UC In-Clinic Follow-up (1 patient)  
- **P1 Dehui** (iHealth F/U) - DM

### Annual Visit (0 patients)
- No patients identified

### Non-iHealth Patient Visit (0 patients)
- No patients identified

## UC Enrollment Scenario (1 patient)

| Phase | Primary Role | Extra Task Name | Frequency | Average Duration | SOP Potential | Patient Cases |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Check-In | Patient | Family Assistance with Documentation | 1 | - | No | P2 Dane: Relatives helped patient fill out intake forms by extracting medication names from pill bottles and writing them on the new patient forms while waiting in lobby |
| Pre-Provider Workflow | MA | Comprehensive Social History Collection | 1 | - | Yes | P2 Dane: MA conducted extensive social history interview in vital room covering family history, dietary habits, substance use, living situation, exercise, caffeine intake, secondhand smoke exposure, and recent travel history |
| Pre-Provider Workflow | MA | EKG Performance | 1 | - | Yes | P2 Dane: MA performed EKG following vital signs collection as part of comprehensive assessment for new diabetic/hypertensive patient |
| UC Device/Program | CA/CM | UC Program Eligibility Screening | 1 | - | Yes | P2 Dane: UC staff assessed patient's home device availability and provided education about UC diabetes management program enrollment |

### Analysis Summary for UC Enrollment:
**Standardizable Tasks (SOP Potential: Yes):**
- Comprehensive Social History Collection: Essential for new UC patients to establish baseline health profile
- EKG Performance: Standard cardiac screening for diabetic/hypertensive patients entering UC program
- UC Program Eligibility Screening: Systematic assessment crucial for appropriate program enrollment

**Non-standardizable Tasks (SOP Potential: No):**
- Family Assistance with Documentation: Family-initiated support that varies by patient and cannot be systematized

**Efficiency Impact:**
If the non-standardizable family assistance task were eliminated (though it's patient-initiated), there would be minimal time savings. The standardizable tasks should be formalized in SOP to ensure consistent quality care for all UC enrollment patients, potentially improving program outcomes and patient satisfaction.

## UC In-Clinic Follow-up Scenario (1 patient)

No extra tasks were identified for P1 Dehui during their iHealth follow-up visit, indicating an efficient, streamlined workflow for established UC patients.

### Analysis Summary for UC In-Clinic Follow-up:
This scenario demonstrates optimal workflow efficiency with no extra tasks identified, suggesting that established UC patients may have more standardized care processes already in place.

---

## Annual Visit Scenario (0 patients)
No patients identified in this category from the current dataset.

---

## Non-iHealth Patient Visit Scenario (0 patients)  
No patients identified in this category from the current dataset.

# Overall Analysis Conclusions

**Key Findings:**
1. **UC Enrollment** requires the most extra tasks (4 total), which is expected for new patient onboarding
2. **UC Follow-up** patients have streamlined workflows with no extra tasks identified
3. 75% of extra tasks (3 out of 4) have high SOP potential and should be standardized

**Recommendations:**
1. Formalize comprehensive social history collection, EKG protocols, and UC eligibility screening into standard UC enrollment procedures
2. The current UC follow-up workflow appears optimized and should serve as a model
3. With only one non-standardizable task identified, the clinic demonstrates good workflow efficiency

**ROI Impact:**
Standardizing the three high-value extra tasks could improve care quality consistency, reduce workflow variability, and enhance patient outcomes without significant time elimination needs, as these tasks add clinical value rather than representing inefficiencies.
