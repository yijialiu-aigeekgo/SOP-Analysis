# KPI Analysis Report: Clinic Workflow Performance

## Executive Summary
Analysis of three patient visits reveals significant operational inefficiencies and SOP compliance gaps, with extensive extra tasks indicating workflow fragmentation and potential quality concerns.

## Key Performance Indicators

### 1. **Wait Time Efficiency**
- **P1 Elizabeth:** 19 minutes (9:54-10:13)
- **Kim:** 26 minutes (10:11-10:37)
- **P3 George:** 6 minutes (10:18-10:24)
- **Average:** 17 minutes
- **KPI Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (Target: <15 min)

### 2. **SOP Compliance Rate**
- **Total SOP Tasks Identified:** 24
- **Completed Checklist Items:** Partially documented
- **Critical Gaps:**
  - Incomplete vital signs documentation (multiple patients)
  - Missing medication reconciliation (Kim, George)
  - Inconsistent patient education documentation
- **KPI Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL (Est. 60-70% compliance)

### 3. **Role Utilization Efficiency**

#### Extra Tasks by Role:
- **MD/NP:** 7 extra tasks (58% of MD/NP activities)
- **CA/CM:** 5 extra tasks (45% of CA/CM activities)
- **MA:** 0 extra tasks (100% SOP adherence)
- **KPI Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CONCERNING (High non-standard activity)

### 4. **Clinical Encounter Duration**
- **P1 Elizabeth:** 7 minutes
- **Kim:** 11 minutes
- **P3 George:** 10 minutes
- **Average:** 9.3 minutes
- **KPI Status:** üî¥ BELOW TARGET (Target: 15-20 min for quality care)

## Critical Findings

### Workflow Disruptions
1. **Insurance Issues Consuming Clinical Time:** Kim's visit devoted significant provider time to insurance coordination
2. **External Lab Integration Problems:** George's visit showed difficulty accessing Sutter lab results
3. **Vital Signs Collection Timing:** Inconsistent vital collection sequences across patients

### Quality Concerns
1. **Rushed Clinical Encounters:** Average 9.3 minutes insufficient for comprehensive care
2. **Documentation Gaps:** Multiple incomplete checklist items
3. **Care Coordination Fragmentation:** CA/CM performing unstructured follow-up tasks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Implement Pre-Visit Insurance Verification** - Reduce MD/NP administrative burden
2. **Standardize Vital Signs Protocol** - Ensure consistent collection and documentation
3. **Deploy Quick Reference SOP Cards** - Improve task completion rates

### Short-term Improvements (Month 1)
1. **Integrate External Lab Portals** - Streamline results access
2. **Extend Clinical Encounter Slots** - Target 15-minute minimums
3. **Create Dedicated Insurance Coordination Role** - Remove from clinical workflow

### Long-term Strategy (Quarter 1)
1. **Implement Real-time SOP Compliance Monitoring** - Digital checklist system
2. **Redesign Patient Flow** - Reduce lobby wait times to <10 minutes
3. **Establish Quality Metrics Dashboard** - Track KPIs in real-time

## Risk Assessment
- **Patient Safety Risk:** MODERATE - Due to rushed encounters and documentation gaps
- **Operational Risk:** HIGH - Significant non-standard activities indicate process breakdown
- **Compliance Risk:** HIGH - SOP adherence below acceptable thresholds

## Conclusion
The clinic demonstrates critical workflow inefficiencies requiring immediate intervention. The 41% rate of extra tasks and sub-optimal clinical encounter times pose risks to both quality of care and operational sustainability. Priority should be given to standardizing workflows and removing administrative tasks from clinical staff responsibilities.
