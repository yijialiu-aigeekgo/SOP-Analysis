# KPI-Oriented Analysis: Patient Enrollment Workflow Assessment

## Executive Summary
Based on the three patient visit records analyzed, I've identified significant workflow inefficiencies and missed enrollment opportunities that directly impact Clinic2's ability to exceed their current 16 patients/week enrollment rate and optimize revenue capture.

## Key Findings & Bottleneck Analysis

### 1. Major Enrollment Bottlenecks

**Pre-Provider Workflow Gaps:**
- **Extended Wait Times**: Patient Kim waited 26 minutes in lobby, indicating front desk processing inefficiencies
- **Fragmented Vitals Collection**: Multiple touchpoints for vital collection (MA â†’ CA/CM review) create redundancy
- **Missing Screening Protocol**: No evidence of systematic RPM/CCM eligibility screening during intake

**Provider Resource Allocation Issues:**
- **Administrative Overhead**: 60% of provider time spent on non-clinical tasks (insurance calls, external lab coordination)
- **Reactive vs. Proactive Care**: Providers responding to patient requests rather than driving enrollment conversations

### 2. Role-Specific Operational Load Assessment

**Highest Operational Load:**
1. **CA/CM Role** - Carrying 40% extra tasks beyond SOP requirements
   - Managing medication refills
   - Post-visit vitals review
   - Provider communication coordination
   - RD appointment scheduling

2. **MD/NP Role** - 50% of encounter time on administrative tasks
   - Insurance coordination calls
   - External system navigation (Sutter labs, UC portal)
   - Chart review across multiple platforms

**Underutilized Resources:**
- **Front Desk**: Limited to basic registration, missing screening opportunities
- **MA**: Brief vital collection only, no patient education or pre-screening

### 3. Patient Persona Enrollment Success Patterns

**High-Engagement Profile** (Elizabeth):
- Active medication management needs
- Regular follow-up compliance
- Multiple touchpoints with care team (CA, RD appointments)
- **Recommendation**: Priority persona for RPM/CCM enrollment

**Complex-Care Profile** (Kim):
- Insurance navigation challenges
- Multiple medication refill needs
- **Risk**: Higher drop-off potential without dedicated support

**Chronic Disease Management Profile** (George):
- Diabetes with worsening A1C (7.1 vs 6.4)
- Multiple lab monitoring requirements
- **Opportunity**: Ideal RPM candidate, but no enrollment discussion documented

## Strategic Workflow Redesign Recommendations

### 4. Process Optimization Strategies

**Front Desk Enhancement:**
- Implement RPM/CCM eligibility pre-screening during registration
- **KPI Target**: Screen 100% of DM/HTN patients at check-in
- **Revenue Impact**: Increase qualified patient pipeline by 25%

**MA Role Expansion:**
- Add device orientation and basic UC+ app introduction during rooming
- **KPI Target**: 80% of eligible patients receive device demo
- **Efficiency Gain**: Reduce CA/CM post-visit workload by 30%

**Provider Workflow Streamlining:**
- Create standardized enrollment conversation templates
- Implement EHR alerts for RPM/CCM eligible patients
- **KPI Target**: 90% of eligible patients receive enrollment discussion

### 5. Technology Integration Opportunities

**UC+ Platform Optimization:**
- Pre-populate patient data to reduce manual entry
- Automated appointment scheduling for RD consultations
- **Efficiency Gain**: Reduce enrollment time from screening to completion by 40%

**EHR Integration:**
- Single sign-on for external lab systems
- Automated vital trend analysis and alerts
- **Provider Time Savings**: 15 minutes per patient encounter

## Growth Strategy Implementation

### 6. Weekly Enrollment Rate Optimization

**Current State**: 16 patients/week
**Target State**: 25+ patients/week (56% increase)

**Phase 1 Actions (0-30 days):**
- Train front desk on RPM/CCM screening protocols
- Implement MA device demonstration workflow
- Create provider enrollment conversation scripts
- **Expected Impact**: 20% increase (19-20 patients/week)

**Phase 2 Actions (30-60 days):**
- Deploy EHR integration for seamless workflows
- Optimize CA/CM role to focus on high-value enrollment support
- Implement automated follow-up for incomplete enrollments
- **Expected Impact**: Additional 25% increase (24-25 patients/week)

**Phase 3
