## Extra Task Analysis

**Administrative Support:** The MD/NP performed administrative coordination by calling Niki to address patient's insurance change request, while the patient initiated an insurance group change request from River City to Hill Physician due to referral communication issues.

**Medication Management:** The patient directly requested medication refills from the CA/CM, who then coordinated with the provider for this request outside of the standard prescription processing workflow.

**Care Coordination:** The CA/CM performed provider communication and care coordination by forwarding patient information to the doctor and managing the pending lab results and appointment status, demonstrating additional coordination efforts beyond standard SOP tasks.
