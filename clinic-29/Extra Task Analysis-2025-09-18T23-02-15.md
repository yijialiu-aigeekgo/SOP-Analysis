**Report Type:** Extra Task Analysis

---

I understand you want me to analyze extra tasks from clinic patient visit records and provide a comprehensive analysis by scenario. However, I don't see any patient data in your message - it appears you're referencing a previous analysis, but I don't have access to that information.

To provide the analysis you're requesting, I would need:

## Required Data:
1. **Patient visit records** with columns like:
   - Patient information (including iHealth program status)
   - Time, Duration, Location
   - Primary Role, Extra Task details
   - Visit type/context

2. **The previous analysis results** you mentioned

## Analysis Framework I'll Apply:

### 1. Scenario Classification & Patient Count:
- **UC Enrollment**: New patients joining iHealth chronic disease management
- **UC In-clinic Follow-up**: iHealth patients for routine follow-up
- **Annual Visit**: iHealth patients for annual check-ups
- **Non-iHealth Patient Visit**: Patients not in iHealth program

### 2. Extra Task Analysis Tables:
For each scenario, I'll create tables with:
- Phase (Check-In, Pre-Provider Workflow, Clinical Encounter, Post-Provider, UC Device/Program, Check-Out)
- Primary Role
- Extra Task Name
- Frequency
- Average Duration (when data available)
- SOP Potential (Yes/No)
- Patient Cases (detailed context)

### 3. Summary Analysis:
- Essential vs. redundant tasks
- Time savings potential
- ROI impact recommendations

**Could you please share the patient visit data or previous analysis results?** Once I have the actual data, I can provide the comprehensive scenario-based extra task analysis you're looking for.
