# KPI Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
Analysis of two standardized patient visits reveals operational efficiency with minimal deviation from SOPs, though opportunities exist for role optimization and workflow standardization.

## Key Performance Metrics

### Visit Efficiency
- **P1 (DM F/U):** 11 minutes total documented time
- **P2 (New Patient DM/HTN):** 42 minutes total documented time
- **Lobby Wait Times:** P1: 6 min | P2: 22 min (new patient forms)

### SOP Compliance Rate
- **P1:** 100% (4/4 tasks per SOP)
- **P2:** 71% (10/14 total tasks per SOP)
- **Overall:** 82% SOP adherence

### Role Utilization

| Role | SOP Tasks | Extra Tasks | Efficiency Score |
|------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| MA | 7 | 2 | 78% |
| CA/CM | 1 | 1 | 50% |
| Front Desk | 2 | 0 | 100% |

## Critical Findings

### Strengths
1. **Complete vital signs collection** (100% compliance)
2. **Proper check-in procedures** maintained
3. **A1C testing** appropriately delegated to CA/CM for diabetic patients

### Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Extra Task Management (ROI Impact: High)
- **EKG Performance:** Currently performed as extra task by MA
- **Social History Collection:** Extended beyond SOP requirements
- **Recommendation:** Standardize protocols for new patient comprehensive assessments

#### 2. Wait Time Optimization (ROI Impact: Medium)
- New patient forms causing 22-minute delays
- **Recommendation:** Implement digital pre-registration to reduce lobby time by 50%

#### 3. Role Clarity (ROI Impact: Medium)
- CA/CM performing UC program introductions outside defined SOP
- **Recommendation:** Formalize UC enrollment protocols within workflow

## ROI-Focused Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Standardize new patient intake:** Create comprehensive checklist including EKG criteria
2. **Digital forms implementation:** Expected 11-minute time savings per new patient

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. **Role redistribution:** Shift UC program introduction to dedicated enrollment specialist
2. **Training reinforcement:** Focus on SOP adherence for 29% non-compliant tasks

### Projected ROI
- **Time Savings:** 15-20% reduction in visit duration
- **Capacity Increase:** Handle 2-3 additional patients per day
- **Quality Metrics:** Maintain 100% vital signs capture while reducing redundant activities

## Performance Dashboard

```
Efficiency Score: 82%
Compliance Rate: 82%
Extra Task Rate: 21% (3/14 tasks)
Average Wait Time: 14 minutes
```

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve standardization recommendations
2. Implement digital intake system
3. Conduct 30-day follow-up audit to measure improvement

**Target KPIs for Next Quarter:**
- SOP Compliance: >95%
- Extra Task Rate: <10%
- Average Wait Time: <10 minutes
- Patient Throughput: +15%
