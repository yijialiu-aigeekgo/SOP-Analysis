Based on the patient visit records provided, I'll analyze the enrollment workflow and identify growth opportunities using the KPI framework:

## **Key Findings & Bottleneck Analysis**

### **1. Enrollment Funnel Efficiency Issues**

**Critical Gap Identified:** Neither patient record shows completion of the full enrollment process
- P1 (Follow-up patient): Only completed vitals collection - no enrollment activities documented
- P2 (New patient): UC introduction occurred but no enrollment completion visible

**Estimated Conversion Rate:** Based on these samples, **0% enrollment completion rate** - indicating severe funnel leakage

### **2. Process Friction Points**

**Time-to-Enrollment Bottlenecks:**
- **Form Management Burden:** P2 spent 22+ minutes on intake forms in lobby with family assistance
- **Role Confusion:** MA performing UC program introduction tasks instead of specialized CA/CM staff
- **Workflow Interruption:** Standard clinical tasks (EKG, vitals) mixed with UC enrollment activities

**Drop-off Risk Factors:**
- No structured handoff between clinical care and UC enrollment
- Patients may leave after medical needs met, before UC enrollment completed
- Complex multi-step process without clear patient journey mapping

### **3. Role Optimization Opportunities**

**MA Operational Overload:**
- P2 visit: MA handled 5+ distinct SOP categories plus extra tasks
- Role redundancy: Both MA and CA/CM involved in patient interaction without clear division

**Recommended Role Redesign:**
```
MA Focus: Clinical tasks only (vitals, medication reconciliation, EKR)
CA/CM Focus: Dedicated UC enrollment specialist (program intro → device setup → app onboarding)
Provider: UC program validation and clinical approval
```

### **4. Patient Persona Insights**

**DM vs DM+HTN Complexity:**
- P2 (DM+HTN) required significantly longer intake process (22 min forms + 18 min vitals)
- Complex medication management may create enrollment barriers
- **Recommendation:** Develop persona-specific enrollment tracks

### **5. Strategic Actions for Growth**

**Immediate Improvements (Target: 20+ patients/week):**

1. **Enrollment Completion Protocol:**
   - Mandatory CA/CM handoff before patient discharge
   - Same-day device distribution and app setup
   - 48-hour follow-up enrollment confirmation call

2. **Workflow Automation:**
   - Pre-visit digital forms (reduce 22-min lobby time)
   - EHR integration for UC eligibility flagging
   - Automated enrollment tracking dashboard

3. **Process Redesign:**
   - Parallel processing: Clinical tasks + UC enrollment simultaneously
   - Dedicated UC enrollment room/station
   - Streamlined consent and device pairing process

**Revenue Impact Projection:**
- Current: 16 patients/week × 52 weeks = 832 annual enrollments
- Target: 24 patients/week × 52 weeks = 1,248 annual enrollments (+50% growth)
- Improved retention through better onboarding = +25% revenue per enrolled patient

### **6. KPI Monitoring Recommendations**

**Weekly Tracking:**
- Screening-to-enrollment conversion rate (Target: >60%)
- Same-day enrollment completion rate (Target: >80%)
- CA/CM utilization efficiency (enrollments per FTE)

**Patient Engagement:**
- 7-day app activation rate post-enrollment
- First device data upload within 48 hours
- 30-day engagement retention rate

**Implementation Priority:** Focus on completing the enrollment funnel before expanding screening volume - current workflow shows patients entering but not successfully enrolling in the UC program.
