**Report Type:** Missing-Task-Analysis

---

Thank you for sharing this detailed missing tasks analysis for patients Dehui and Dane. This appears to be a comprehensive audit of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) across different healthcare roles - Front Desk, Medical Assistant (MA), and Care Assistant/Care Manager (CA/CM).

## Key Observations:

### **High-Impact Missing Tasks:**
1. **Patient Safety**: ID verification and vital sign validation processes
2. **Clinical Quality**: Medication reconciliation and care gap identification
3. **Patient Experience**: Chief complaint capture and patient education
4. **Revenue Cycle**: Co-pay collection and billing processes

### **Pattern Analysis:**
- **Front Desk**: Consistent gaps in verification processes (ID, DOB, insurance)
- **MA Role**: Mixed completion rates, with rooming and preventive screening frequently missed
- **CA/CM Role**: Significant gaps in patient education and comprehensive reviews

### **Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Focus**: Prioritize patient safety tasks (ID verification, vital sign validation)
2. **Training Needs**: Develop targeted training for consistently missed tasks
3. **Workflow Optimization**: Review task assignments between MA and CA/CM roles
4. **Quality Metrics**: Establish completion rate targets for each SOP category

Would you like me to:
- Analyze completion rates by role or task category?
- Suggest a prioritization framework for addressing these gaps?
- Develop specific training recommendations?
- Create a monitoring dashboard structure?

What aspect would be most helpful for your quality improvement initiatives?
