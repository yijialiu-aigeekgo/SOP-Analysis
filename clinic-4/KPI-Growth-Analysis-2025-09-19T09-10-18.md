I understand you're looking to analyze the offline patient enrollment workflow for UC (Unified Care) to identify growth opportunities and optimize the process. However, I notice that the actual SOP documentation and patient visit logs aren't included in your prompt - you've only provided "123" as placeholder data.

To conduct the comprehensive KPI-oriented analysis you've outlined, I would need:

## Required Data Inputs:

**1. SOP Documentation:**
- Complete enrollment workflow steps
- Role responsibilities (MA, CA, Provider, RD)
- Decision points and handoff procedures
- Current screening criteria and processes

**2. Patient Visit Records:**
- Timestamped enrollment activities
- Patient flow through each SOP step
- Drop-off points and completion rates
- Staff interaction logs

**3. Performance Metrics:**
- Current funnel conversion rates at each step
- Time-to-enrollment data
- Patient engagement metrics post-enrollment
- Role-specific productivity measures

## Analysis Framework Ready:

Once you provide the actual SOP and visit data, I can deliver:

✅ **Bottleneck Analysis** - Identify where patients drop off most frequently
✅ **Role Efficiency Audit** - Highlight redundancies and operational overload
✅ **Patient Persona Insights** - Compare DM, HTN, DM+HTN enrollment success rates
✅ **Process Optimization Recommendations** - Specific workflow redesign suggestions
✅ **Growth Strategy** - Actionable steps to exceed 16 patients/week target

Could you please share the complete SOP documentation and patient visit records? This will enable me to provide the data-driven insights needed to optimize Clinic2's enrollment performance and revenue capture.
