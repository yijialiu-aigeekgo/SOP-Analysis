I'd be happy to help you standardize a patient visit record! However, I notice that you've only provided "123" as the patient visit logs. 

To properly process and standardize the visit record, I need the actual raw patient visit data that includes:
- Timestamps of activities
- Descriptions of what occurred during the visit
- Staff interactions
- Patient flow through the facility
- Any clinical or administrative activities performed

Could you please provide the complete raw patient visit record that needs to be standardized? It should look something like:

```
Patient: [Name], [Conditions]
10:50 - Check in at front desk
11:00 - MA calls patient for vitals
11:05 - Vitals taken: BP 130/85, Weight 180lbs
11:15 - Provider enters room
...etc
```

Once you provide the actual visit record, I'll transform it into the standardized format with:
- Structured table with all required columns
- SOP category and task matching
- Completed checklist items
- Role performance summary
- Patient journey flow

Please share the complete patient visit record you'd like me to standardize.
