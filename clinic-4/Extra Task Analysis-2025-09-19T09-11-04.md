**Report Type:** Extra Task Analysis

---

I understand you want me to analyze extra tasks by scenario from clinic patient visit data, but I don't see the actual data from your previous analysis that you'd like me to work with.

To provide the comprehensive scenario-based extra task analysis you've requested, I need:

**The standardized patient visit records** that should include:
- Patient information (to determine if they're iHealth patients)
- Visit workflow data with extra tasks identified
- Time/duration data
- Role assignments
- Task details

Once you provide this data, I'll deliver:

## 1. Scenario Classification & Patient Count
- **UC Enrollment**: New iHealth chronic disease management enrollees
- **UC In-clinic Follow-up**: Existing iHealth patients for follow-up visits  
- **Annual Visit**: iHealth patients for annual check-ups
- **Non-iHealth Patient Visit**: Patients not in iHealth program (default if not explicitly stated)

## 2. Scenario-Specific Extra Task Tables
For each scenario, a table with columns:
- **Phase**: Check-In, Pre-Provider Workflow, Clinical Encounter, Post-Provider, UC Device/Program, Check-Out
- **Primary Role**: Staff member responsible
- **Extra Task Name**: Specific task description
- **Frequency**: Number of patients with this task
- **Average Duration**: Time spent (when data available)
- **SOP Potential**: Yes/No assessment
- **Patient Cases**: Detailed context for each occurrence

## 3. Scenario Analysis & Recommendations
- Essential tasks worth standardizing in SOPs
- Redundant/low-value tasks to eliminate
- Time savings potential and operational efficiency gains

Could you please share the patient visit analysis data you mentioned? Once I have it, I'll provide the complete scenario-based extra task breakdown you need.
