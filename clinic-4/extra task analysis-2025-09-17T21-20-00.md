**Report Type:** extra task analysis

---

I understand you want me to analyze extra tasks by scenario, but I notice that you mentioned you previously analyzed many patients' visit processes, but I only have access to one incomplete patient record (P3 Yuehong). 

To provide the comprehensive analysis you're requesting, I would need:

## Required Data for Analysis:

1. **Complete patient visit records** for multiple patients showing their full journey from check-in to check-out
2. **Patient information** clearly indicating their iHealth program status
3. **Extra tasks documentation** for each patient across all workflow phases

## What I Can See Currently:

From the single incomplete record provided (P3 Yuehong), I can only identify this as a potential **UC Enrollment** case since:
- Patient has DM/HTN conditions
- Initial UC device education was mentioned
- But the record is incomplete, cutting off during Pre-Provider Workflow

## What I Need to Provide Your Requested Analysis:

### 1. **Patient Classification Data:**
- Complete patient records with clear iHealth program status
- Visit context (enrollment, follow-up, annual, or non-iHealth)

### 2. **Extra Tasks Documentation:**
- Detailed extra tasks performed by each role
- Time stamps and durations
- Context of why each extra task was performed

### 3. **Multiple Scenarios:**
- UC Enrollment cases
- UC in-clinic follow-up cases  
- Annual visit cases
- Non-iHealth patient visit cases

**Could you please provide the complete dataset of patient visit records you mentioned analyzing previously?** Once I have access to the full data, I can deliver the comprehensive scenario-based analysis with:

- Patient count and demographics by scenario
- Detailed extra task tables for each scenario
- Frequency and duration analysis
- SOP potential assessment
- ROI and efficiency improvement recommendations

Would you be able to share the complete patient visit data you referenced?
