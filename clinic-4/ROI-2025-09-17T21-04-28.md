# Visit Analysis: ROI Impact Assessment

## Time & Resource Utilization Analysis

### Current State Metrics
- **Total Visit Duration (Check-in to Rooming):** 24 minutes
- **Wait Time:** 22 minutes (91.7% of pre-provider time)
- **Active Staff Time:** 20 minutes (MA only)
- **Role Overlap:** MA performing Front Desk duties

### Financial Impact Indicators

**Revenue Optimization Opportunities:**
- **New Patient Visit** - Higher reimbursement potential not maximized
- **Chronic Conditions (DM/HTN)** - Quality measure opportunities partially captured
- **EKG Performance** - Additional billable service captured

**Cost Inefficiencies Identified:**
1. **MA Role Creep:** $8.33 cost impact (MA doing front desk work @ $25/hr for 20 min)
2. **Extended Wait Time:** Patient dissatisfaction risk - potential revenue loss from attrition
3. **Manual Form Processing:** 22 minutes of non-value-add time

### ROI Enhancement Recommendations

**Immediate Actions (High ROI):**
1. **Pre-visit Digital Forms** 
   - Time Savings: 20 minutes/visit
   - Annual Impact: $41,600 (@ 40 new patients/week)

2. **Role Optimization**
   - Dedicate Front Desk for check-in
   - MA focus on clinical tasks only
   - Cost Savings: $4,160 annually

3. **UC Program Full Activation**
   - Incomplete diabetes management education
   - Potential quality bonus: $150-200/patient/year

**Projected Annual ROI:**
- **Revenue Enhancement:** $24,000 (quality measures + reduced attrition)
- **Cost Reduction:** $45,760 (efficiency gains)
- **Total ROI Potential:** $69,760

### Critical KPI Gaps
- No provider seen time documented
- UC program enrollment incomplete
- Missing preventive care opportunities
