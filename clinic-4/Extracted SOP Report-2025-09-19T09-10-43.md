I understand you want to analyze clinic workflow data, but I notice you've only provided "123" instead of the actual documents mentioned in the prompt. 

To complete this analysis, I would need:

1. **Clinic visit logs** - The detailed patient encounter records with:
   - Patient identifiers
   - Timestamps for each activity
   - Task descriptions
   - Staff roles involved
   - Durations of tasks
   - Locations where activities occurred

2. **SOP reference guide** - The document containing:
   - Official task codes
   - Task descriptions
   - Standard procedures

Could you please provide these two documents? Once you share the actual data, I can:
- Categorize patients by visit type (iHealth Enrollment, iHealth Follow-Up, or Regular)
- Extract actual durations from the logs
- Map activities to SOP codes
- Create workflow tables showing the standardized process for each scenario
- Calculate accurate average durations based only on the recorded data

Please paste the clinic visit logs and SOP reference guide, and I'll proceed with the analysis following the strict duration calculation requirements outlined in your prompt.
