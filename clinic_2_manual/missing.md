Clinic 2 Missing Tasks Analysis 
Key Findings Summary
Critical Universal Gaps (Top 5)
Provider Documentation (CE.8) - 88% missing rate across all visits
Co-Pay Collection (CI.2) - 82% missing rate at front desk
Demographics Update (CI.3) - 76% missing rate at front desk
Chief Complaint Capture (PP.3) - 76% missing rate for MAs
Physical Exam Documentation (CE.2) - 71% missing rate for providers
Visit Scenario Patterns
Standard visits show highest documentation gaps (100% missing CE.8)
iHealth enrollment visits have significant UC program setup failures
iHealth follow-up visits show better compliance but still have 75% documentation gaps
Complex iHealth visits require CA/CM coordination that frequently fails
Role-Specific Risk Profiles
Providers: Highest risk in documentation and assessment completion
Front Desk: Revenue cycle risks through billing collection failures
Medical Assistants: Patient safety risks through incomplete vital signs and chief complaint capture
Care Assistants: Program compliance risks in specialized iHealth workflows
Strategic Recommendations
Immediate Actions
Implement mandatory provider documentation completion before visit closure
Establish co-pay collection protocols with payment plan alternatives
Create chief complaint capture quality checks
Deploy real-time task completion dashboards
Medium-term Initiatives 
Redesign EHR workflows to enforce sequential task completion
Implement role-based training programs targeting highest-risk gaps
Create specialized iHealth workflow protocols
Long-term Strategic Changes 
Integrate automated task validation into EHR systems
Develop predictive analytics for workflow risk identification
This analysis reveals systematic workflow failures across all roles with critical implications for patient safety, revenue cycle, and regulatory compliance. The 88% documentation failure rate represents the highest priority risk requiring immediate intervention.
