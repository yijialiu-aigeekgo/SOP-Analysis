Based on the provided patient visit records, I'll analyze the KPIs and ROI considerations for these standardized workflows:

## Key Performance Indicators Analysis

### 1. **Workflow Efficiency Metrics**

**P2 Dehui Visit:**
- Total pre-provider time: 10 minutes (highly efficient)
- Wait time: 6 minutes (60% of total time)
- Active care time: 4 minutes (40% of total time)
- Role utilization: MA (2 tasks), CA/CM (1 task)

**P3 Yuehong Visit:**
- Total pre-provider time: 40 minutes
- Wait time: 22 minutes (55% of total time)
- Active care time: 18 minutes (45% of total time)
- Role utilization: Front Desk (1 task), MA (4 tasks), CA/CM (1 extra task)

### 2. **SOP Compliance Rate**

**P2 Visit:** 100% SOP compliance
- All tasks aligned with standard protocols
- No extra tasks performed

**P3 Visit:** 71% SOP compliance
- 5 SOP-aligned tasks
- 2 extra tasks (EKG, UC Program Explanation)

### 3. **Resource Optimization Opportunities**

**Wait Time Reduction:**
- P3's 22-minute lobby wait suggests bottleneck in new patient processing
- Potential for pre-visit digital form completion to reduce wait by 15+ minutes

**Task Distribution:**
- MA performing multiple sequential tasks in P3 visit (18 minutes) could be parallelized
- CA/CM underutilized in both visits

## ROI Calculation Framework

### Cost Savings Potential:

**Time Efficiency Gains:**
- Reducing average wait time from 14 minutes to 5 minutes = 9 minutes saved/patient
- At $40/hour average staff cost: $6 saved per patient
- For 20 patients/day: $120 daily savings

**Digital Transformation ROI:**
- Pre-visit digital forms could eliminate 15 minutes of lobby time
- Estimated implementation cost: $5,000
- Break-even: ~42 days at current patient volume

### Revenue Enhancement:

**Increased Patient Throughput:**
- Current capacity: ~12 patients/provider/day
- With optimized workflow: 15 patients/provider/day
- Additional revenue potential: 3 visits Ã— $150 average = $450/day/provider

**Quality Metrics Impact:**
- A1C testing completion (P2): Direct quality measure compliance
- EKG performance (P3): Potential additional billing opportunity ($50-75/test)

## Recommendations for KPI Improvement:

1. **Implement pre-visit digital intake** 
   - Target: Reduce new patient wait time by 70%
   - ROI: 3-month payback period

2. **Standardize extra task protocols**
   - Create billing codes for common extra tasks
   - Track frequency to justify resource allocation

3. **Optimize role distribution**
   - Cross-train MAs for UC device education
   - Reduce handoffs between roles

4. **Establish benchmark targets:**
   - Wait time: <5 minutes
   - Active care time: <15 minutes for follow-ups, <25 minutes for new patients
   - SOP compliance: >85%

This KPI-focused analysis demonstrates clear opportunities for operational improvement with quantifiable ROI potential through reduced wait times, increased throughput, and better resource utilization.
