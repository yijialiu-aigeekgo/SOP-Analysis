I'll analyze these two patient visit records to identify KPIs and outcomes related to workflow efficiency and SOP adherence.

## Key Performance Indicators Analysis

### Patient P2 (Diabetes Follow-up)
**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Total visit time (documented): 9 minutes
- Wait time: 6 minutes (67% of documented time)
- Clinical care time: 3 minutes (33% of documented time)
- SOP compliance: 100% (no extra tasks performed)

### Patient P3 (New Patient - DM/HTN)
**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Total visit time (documented): 42 minutes
- Wait time: 22 minutes (52% of documented time)
- Clinical care time: 20 minutes (48% of documented time)
- SOP compliance: Partial (2 extra tasks performed)
- Form completion time: 22 minutes (excessive for standard intake)

## Critical Outcomes Identified

### 1. **Workflow Bottlenecks**
- **P3 New Patient Processing:** 22-minute wait for form completion indicates insufficient pre-visit preparation or complexity in intake forms
- **Rooming Delays:** P3's 18-minute vital room session suggests task bundling inefficiency

### 2. **Role Boundary Issues**
- **MA Scope Creep (P3):** MA performed:
  - EKG (typically requires specific training/certification)
  - Extensive social history collection (beyond SOP requirements)
  - These extra tasks consumed valuable time and may exceed role definition

### 3. **Process Standardization Gaps**
- **Inconsistent New Patient Workflow:** P3's visit shows:
  - Forms given at arrival instead of pre-visit
  - Family assistance needed for medication documentation
  - Multiple staff touching same process (MA/Front Desk overlap)

### 4. **Resource Utilization**
- **P2:** Efficient use of CA/CM for specialized A1C testing
- **P3:** Potential over-utilization of MA for tasks that could be:
  - Pre-collected via portal/phone
  - Delegated to other roles
  - Streamlined through better forms

## Recommended KPI Targets

### Immediate Metrics to Track:
1. **Wait Time Ratio:** Target <30% of total visit time
2. **SOP Adherence Rate:** Target >95% (tasks within defined roles)
3. **New Patient Intake Time:** Target <10 minutes for forms
4. **Pre-Provider Workflow Duration:** Target <10 minutes for follow-ups, <15 minutes for new patients

### Quality Indicators:
1. **Incomplete Checklist Items:** Track unchecked items per visit
2. **Extra Task Frequency:** Monitor and categorize non-SOP activities
3. **Role-Task Alignment:** Percentage of tasks performed by designated role

## Action Items for Improvement

1. **Standardize New Patient Intake:**
   - Implement pre-visit digital forms
   - Create medication reconciliation template
   - Define clear MA vs. Front Desk responsibilities

2. **Optimize MA Utilization:**
   - Clarify scope of practice boundaries
   - Redistribute social history collection to providers or pre-visit questionnaires
   - Establish time limits for vital collection tasks

3. **Reduce Wait Times:**
   - Implement appointment staggering for new patients
   - Create express lanes for simple follow-ups like P2
   - Deploy digital check-in to reduce front desk burden

These KPIs reveal significant opportunities for workflow optimization, particularly in new patient processing and role definition clarity.
