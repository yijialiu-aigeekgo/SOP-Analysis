**Report Type:** Missing-Task-Analysis

---

Thank you for sharing this detailed Missing Tasks Analysis for Patients 2 (Dehui) and 3 (Yuehong). This appears to be a comprehensive audit of standard operating procedures (SOPs) across different roles in what seems to be a healthcare clinic setting.

## Key Observations:

### **Front Desk Performance:**
- Basic arrival processing is being completed consistently
- **Critical gaps** in financial processes (co-pay collection) and verification procedures (ID, insurance)
- Demographics updates are inconsistent

### **Medical Assistant (MA) Performance:**
- Vitals collection is happening but lacks quality control measures
- **Major gaps** in patient rooming procedures and preventive health screenings
- Chief complaint capture is partially completed but not properly documented

### **Care Assistant/Care Manager (CA/CM) Performance:**
- **Significant deficiencies** across most tasks
- Patient education and care coordination appear to be largely missing
- UC (presumably "Unified Care" or similar program) enrollment processes are incomplete

### **Areas of Immediate Concern:**
1. **Patient Safety**: Missing ID verification and abnormal value flagging
2. **Revenue Cycle**: No co-pay collection processes being followed
3. **Care Quality**: Preventive screenings and patient education not occurring
4. **Documentation**: Incomplete EHR updates and care gap identification

## Questions for Clarification:
- What is the expected compliance percentage for these SOPs?
- Are there specific reasons why certain role-based tasks aren't being completed?
- Is there additional training or resource allocation needed?

Would you like me to help analyze specific patterns, suggest improvement strategies, or create an action plan based on these findings?
