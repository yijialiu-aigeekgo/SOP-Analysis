# KPI-Oriented Analysis: Offline Patient Enrollment Workflow

## Executive Summary
Based on the patient visit records analyzed, several critical enrollment bottlenecks and workflow inefficiencies have been identified that directly impact Clinic2's ability to exceed their current 16 patients/week enrollment rate and optimize revenue capture from CMS-billable RPM/CCM services.

## Key Findings & KPI Impact Analysis

### 1. Enrollment Funnel Efficiency Gaps

**Major Bottleneck: Extended Pre-Provider Wait Times**
- P3 case: 22-minute lobby wait for form completion
- **KPI Impact**: Reduces daily patient throughput capacity, limiting weekly enrollment potential
- **Revenue Impact**: Opportunity cost of ~2-3 additional screenings per day

**Form Management Inefficiency**
- New patients require extensive manual form completion in lobby
- Family assistance needed (P3 case) indicates accessibility/language barriers
- **KPI Impact**: Likely reduces % of screened patients who complete enrollment

### 2. Process Friction Points Analysis

**Time-to-Enrollment Bottlenecks:**
- **Check-in Process**: 24-minute average (2min registration + 22min forms)
- **Vital Collection**: 18-minute comprehensive session including multiple reconciliations
- **Total Pre-Provider Time**: 42 minutes per patient

**Drop-off Risk Factors Identified:**
- Language barriers requiring family translation assistance
- Complex medication reconciliation for DM/HTN patients
- Multiple role handoffs (Front Desk → MA → CA/CM → Provider)

### 3. Operational Load & Role Redundancy

**MA Role Overload:**
- Performing 4+ distinct SOP tasks per patient
- Adding extra clinical tasks (EKG) beyond standard workflow
- **Efficiency Impact**: Creates scheduling bottlenecks, limits daily patient volume

**CA/CM Underutilization:**
- Limited to device inquiry and program explanation
- Not integrated into early enrollment screening
- **Optimization Opportunity**: Earlier engagement could improve enrollment conversion

### 4. Patient Persona Analysis

**DM vs DM+HTN Complexity:**
- DM+HTN patients (P3) require significantly more time (40+ minutes total)
- Additional medication reconciliation complexity
- **Strategic Implication**: May need differentiated enrollment pathways

**Follow-up Patient Efficiency (P2):**
- Only 10 minutes total visit time
- Streamlined workflow demonstrates optimization potential
- **KPI Insight**: Established patients show higher engagement efficiency

## Strategic Recommendations for Growth

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)

1. **Digital Form Pre-Population**
   - Implement online intake forms sent 24-48 hours pre-visit
   - **Target**: Reduce lobby wait time by 75% (22min → 5min)
   - **Expected Impact**: +20% daily screening capacity

2. **Role Rebalancing**
   - Shift medication reconciliation to CA/CM role
   - MA focuses on vital collection only
   - **Target**: Reduce MA time per patient by 30%

### Medium-term Optimizations (30-90 days)

3. **Enrollment Pathway Segmentation**
   - Fast-track for DM-only patients
   - Extended pathway for complex DM+HTN cases
   - **Target**: Improve enrollment completion rate by 25%

4. **UC+ App Pre-Engagement**
   - CA/CM conducts device setup during vital collection
   - Patient downloads app before provider consultation
   - **Target**: Increase 1st follow-up completion rate

### Long-term Strategic Initiatives (90+ days)

5. **Automated Screening Integration**
   - EHR-triggered enrollment flags for eligible patients
   - Proactive outreach for RPM/CCM candidates
   - **Target**: Double weekly enrollment rate (16 → 32 patients/week)

## Projected KPI Improvements

**Enrollment Funnel Efficiency:**
- Current: ~60% screening-to-enrollment (estimated)
- Target: 80% with optimized workflow

**Weekly Enrollment Rate:**
- Current: 16 patients/week
- 6-month target: 25 patients/week
- 12-month target: 35 patients/week

**Patient Engagement:**
- Target: 90% of enrollees completing 1st follow-up
- Target: 75% active UC+ app usage within
