# Extra Tasks Analysis by Scenario

## Scenario Classification and Patient Count

### 1. UC Enrollment: 1 patient
- **P3 Yuehong** (Clinic's new patient; iHealth new patient) - DM/HTN. Reason for visit: refill med. Appt: 3:00

### 2. UC In-clinic Follow-up: 1 patient  
- **P2 Dehui** (iHealth F/U) - DM

### 3. Annual Visit: 0 patients
- No patients identified with annual visit scenario

### 4. Non-iHealth Patient Visit: 0 patients
- No patients identified as non-iHealth patients

## UC Enrollment Scenario Analysis

**Patient Count: 1**
**Patient:** P3 Yuehong (Clinic's new patient; iHealth new patient) - DM/HTN. Reason for visit: refill med. Appt: 3:00

| Phase | Primary Role | Extra Task Name | Frequency | Average Duration | SOP Potential | Patient Cases |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Clinical Encounter | MA | EKG Performance | 1/1 | 18 mins (total encounter) | Yes | P3 Yuehong: EKG performed during comprehensive vital signs collection for new DM/HTN patient during medication refill visit, conducted alongside standard vitals, medication reconciliation, and social history gathering |
| UC Device/Program | CA/CM | Device Inquiry & UC Program Explanation | 1/1 | Not specified | Yes | P3 Yuehong: CA/CM inquired about home monitoring devices and explained UC diabetes management program as part of new patient onboarding process for DM/HTN patient seeking medication refills |

### UC Enrollment Scenario Summary

**Essential SOP-worthy tasks (2/2):**
- **EKG Performance**: Standardizable cardiac screening for DM/HTN patients that enhances diagnostic capabilities
- **Device Inquiry & UC Program Explanation**: Critical onboarding component for UC enrollment that ensures proper patient education and care coordination setup

**Analysis:** All identified extra tasks in UC enrollment are valuable and should be standardized. These tasks represent essential components of comprehensive diabetic care and program onboarding that directly support patient outcomes and care coordination.

**Efficiency Impact:** Since both tasks are valuable for patient care quality and program success, eliminating them would not improve ROI. Instead, standardizing these processes could improve efficiency by creating consistent workflows and reducing variability in care delivery.

## UC In-clinic Follow-up Scenario Analysis

**Patient Count: 1**
**Patient:** P2 Dehui (iHealth F/U) - DM

| Phase | Primary Role | Extra Task Name | Frequency | Average Duration | SOP Potential | Patient Cases |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| - | - | No extra tasks identified | 0/1 | - | - | P2 Dehui: All activities followed standard SOP procedures with no additional tasks beyond routine follow-up care |

### UC In-clinic Follow-up Scenario Summary

**Analysis:** This scenario demonstrates optimal workflow efficiency with no extra tasks identified. The patient's follow-up visit proceeded according to standard protocols, suggesting that established UC follow-up procedures are well-defined and being followed appropriately.

**Efficiency Impact:** No time savings opportunities identified as workflow is already optimized for this scenario type.

## Overall Cross-Scenario Analysis

**Key Findings:**
1. **UC Enrollment** requires additional standardizable tasks that enhance care quality
2. **UC Follow-up** demonstrates streamlined, efficient workflows  
3. **Program Maturity Effect**: Follow-up visits show more standardized processes compared to enrollment visits
4. **Care Coordination Value**: Extra tasks in enrollment focus on patient education and clinical assessment, both critical for long-term program success

**ROI Optimization Recommendations:**
- Standardize UC enrollment extra tasks into formal SOPs to reduce variability
- Use UC follow-up efficiency as benchmark for other scenarios
- Focus on process standardization rather than task elimination to maintain care quality while improving consistency
