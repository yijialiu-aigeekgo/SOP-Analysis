Looking at these Standardized Patient Visit Records, I can see detailed documentation of patient workflows with clear categorization of SOP tasks and extra tasks. Let me provide analysis of the key performance indicators based on the data:

## Key Performance Metrics Analysis

### P2 Dehui Visit (DM Follow-up)
- **Total Visit Time Tracked**: 9 minutes (3:07-3:16)
- **Wait Time**: 6 minutes (67% of tracked time)
- **Active Care Time**: 3 minutes
- **SOP Compliance**: 100% - All tasks aligned with standard procedures
- **Extra Tasks**: 0

### P3 Yuehong Visit (New Patient - DM/HTN)
- **Total Visit Time Tracked**: 42 minutes (2:58-3:40)
- **Wait Time**: 22 minutes (52% of tracked time)
- **Active Care Time**: 20 minutes
- **SOP Compliance**: Partial - Most tasks followed SOP
- **Extra Tasks**: 2 identified
  - EKG Performance by MA
  - Device Inquiry & UC Program Explanation by CA/CM

## Key Insights:

### Efficiency Indicators:
1. **Wait Time Ratio**: Both visits show significant lobby wait times (67% and 52% respectively), suggesting potential scheduling or workflow bottlenecks
2. **New vs. Follow-up Processing**: New patient (P3) required 4.7x more time than follow-up (P2)

### Quality & Compliance:
1. **Documentation Completeness**: Both records show comprehensive checklist tracking
2. **Role Clarity**: Clear delineation of responsibilities between MA, CA/CM, and Front Desk staff
3. **Extra Services**: P3 received additional diagnostic services (EKG) and program education beyond standard SOP

### Opportunities for Improvement:
1. Reduce lobby wait times through better appointment scheduling
2. Standardize when EKGs should be performed for new DM/HTN patients
3. Formalize UC program introduction into SOP for eligible patients

Would you like me to analyze any specific KPIs or create additional metrics from this data?
