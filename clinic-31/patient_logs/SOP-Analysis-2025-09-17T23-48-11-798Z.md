## Extra Task Analysis

**Chart Management Services:** MA performed patient chart handoff to provider, while MD/NP conducted patient chart review before entering the exam room. These manual chart handling processes indicate a paper-based or hybrid documentation system not fully captured in the SOP Guide's EHR-focused workflows.

**Workflow Coordination:** The direct handoff of patient charts between MA and provider represents a coordination step that bridges the Pre-Provider Workflow and Clinical Encounter phases, ensuring provider readiness before patient interaction.
