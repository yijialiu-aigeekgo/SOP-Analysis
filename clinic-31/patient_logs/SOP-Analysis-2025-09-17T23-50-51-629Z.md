## Extra Task Analysis

**Chart Management Services:** MA performed physical chart handoff to provider, and MD/NP conducted patient chart review prior to encounter - both activities represent traditional paper-based workflow elements not explicitly covered in the digital EHR-focused SOP Guide.

**Process Gaps:** The visit lacked several standard SOP components including rooming procedures, medication reconciliation, after-visit summary delivery, and referral management documentation. The MRI referral ordering and insurance authorization process mentioned by the provider was not followed up with formal referral management procedures.
