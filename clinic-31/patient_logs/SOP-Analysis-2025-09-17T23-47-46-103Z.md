## Extra Task Analysis

**Social Engagement:** The MD/NP engaged in social conversation with the patient about volleyball activities. While this builds rapport and is part of good patient care, it represents time spent outside the formal SOP clinical encounter tasks. This informal interaction occurred for approximately 4 minutes during the clinical encounter.
