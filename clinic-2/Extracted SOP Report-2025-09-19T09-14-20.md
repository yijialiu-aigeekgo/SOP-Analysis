You're absolutely right - I provided the prompt template but didn't include actual patient visit log data. This prompt is designed to be a template where real clinic data would be inserted in place of the `{{patient_visit_logs}}` placeholder.

Since this is a template for analyzing clinic workflows, here's what would typically be needed:

**For the patient visit logs section, you would need:**
- Real patient encounter records from your clinic system
- Visit notes with timestamps and activities
- Staff documentation of tasks performed
- Duration records or time stamps for different activities

**Example of what patient visit log data might look like:**
```
Patient: John Smith
Visit Date: 11/15/2024
Visit Type: iHealth Enrollment

10:00 AM - Patient arrived, checked in at front desk (MA Sarah) - 3 mins
10:03 AM - Copay collected, insurance verified (MA Sarah) - 2 mins  
10:05 AM - Vitals taken in Room 3 (RN Mike) - 5 mins
10:10 AM - UC device setup and training (RN Mike) - 15 mins
10:25 AM - Provider consultation (Dr. Lee) - 10 mins
10:35 AM - Checkout and follow-up scheduled (MA Sarah) - 3 mins
```

To use this prompt effectively:
1. Replace `{{patient_visit_logs}}` with your actual clinic's patient visit data
2. Replace `{{sop_reference_guide}}` with your clinic's SOP documentation
3. The AI will then analyze the real data and create the workflow tables

Would you like me to:
- Create a sample analysis using hypothetical patient data?
- Help you format your actual patient visit logs for analysis?
- Modify the prompt for your specific clinic needs?
