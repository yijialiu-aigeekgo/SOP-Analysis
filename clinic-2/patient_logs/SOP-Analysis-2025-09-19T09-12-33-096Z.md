I'll help you standardize the patient visit record, but I notice that the actual patient visit log data wasn't included in your message. You've provided the comprehensive prompt with the SOP Reference Guide, but the section marked `{{patient_visit_logs}}` appears to be a placeholder.

Could you please provide the raw patient visit record that needs to be standardized? It should contain information like:
- Timestamps of activities
- Patient information (name, conditions, visit type)
- Activities performed during the visit
- Staff interactions
- Any procedures or services provided

Once you share the actual patient visit data, I'll transform it into the standardized format following all the guidelines you've outlined, including:
- The structured markdown table with all required columns
- Role Performance Summary
- Patient Journey Flow
- Proper SOP task matching and checklist completion tracking
- Identification of any extra tasks not covered in the SOP

Please paste the raw patient visit record, and I'll process it according to your specifications.
