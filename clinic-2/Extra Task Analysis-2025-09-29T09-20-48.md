### UC In-clinic Follow-up: 1 patient  
- **P2 Dehui** (iHealth F/U) - DM

### Annual Visit: 0 patients
- No patients identified for this scenario

### Non-iHealth Patient Visit: 0 patients

## UC Enrollment Analysis

### Extra Tasks Summary Table

| Phase | Primary Role | Extra Task Name | Frequency | Average Duration | SOP Potential | Patient Cases |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Pre-Provider Workflow | MA | EKG Performance | 1 | 18 mins (total session) | Yes | P3 Yuehong - EKG was performed during comprehensive new patient intake in vital room alongside standard vitals, medication reconciliation, and UC enrollment. Patient presented with DM/HTN comorbidities requiring baseline cardiac assessment before initiating chronic disease management program. |
| Pre-Provider Workflow | MA | Comprehensive Social History Collection | 1 | 18 mins (total session) | Yes | P3 Yuehong - Extensive social history gathered including family history, lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol, exercise, diet), living situation, travel history, and environmental exposures. This occurred during new patient rooming process as part of comprehensive assessment for UC diabetes management program enrollment. |

### UC Enrollment Scenario Analysis

**High-Value Tasks for SOP Integration:**
- **EKG Performance**: Essential for establishing baseline cardiac status in new UC enrollees with cardiovascular risk factors (DM/HTN). This represents a standardizable clinical procedure that should be systematically included in UC enrollment protocols.
- **Comprehensive Social History Collection**: Critical for personalized chronic disease management planning. Social determinants of health directly impact diabetes and hypertension outcomes, making this data collection valuable for UC program success.

**Operational Impact:**
- Both extra tasks identified have high SOP potential and clinical value
- No redundant or low-value tasks were identified for elimination
- These tasks represent necessary comprehensive assessment activities that enhance UC enrollment quality
- Rather than eliminating tasks, standardizing these activities in SOPs would:
  - Ensure consistent baseline data collection for all UC enrollees
  - Improve care quality and chronic disease management outcomes
  - Reduce variability in enrollment processes
  - Potentially improve UC program ROI through better patient stratification and personalized care planning

**Time Investment Analysis:**
- Total extra task time: 18 minutes (combined session)
- This represents a one-time investment during UC enrollment that likely provides long-term value through improved chronic disease management and reduced future complications

## UC In-clinic Follow-up Analysis

### Extra Tasks Summary Table
No extra tasks were identified for this scenario.

### UC In-clinic Follow-up Scenario Analysis
**Key Finding:** The established UC follow-up patient (P2 Dehui) required no extra tasks, suggesting that existing SOPs for UC follow-up visits are comprehensive and well-defined. This indicates operational efficiency in the established patient workflow.

## Overall Cross-Scenario Analysis

**Operational Efficiency Insights:**
1. **UC Enrollment** requires more comprehensive assessment activities (justifiably so for baseline establishment)
2. **UC Follow-up** operates efficiently with existing SOPs
3. **Primary opportunity**: Standardize the valuable extra tasks identified in UC enrollment to ensure consistent, high-quality program onboarding
4. **ROI Enhancement**: Rather than eliminating tasks, systematizing the comprehensive assessment approach for new UC enrollees will likely improve chronic disease management outcomes and long-term patient engagement with the program

**Recommendation:** Focus on SOP development for UC enrollment processes to standardize EKG performance and comprehensive social history collection protocols, ensuring all new chronic disease management patients receive consistent, thorough baseline assessments.
