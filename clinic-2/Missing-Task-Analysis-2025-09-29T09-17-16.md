Thank you for sharing the missing tasks analysis for Patients 2 (Dehui) and 3 (Yuehong). This is a comprehensive breakdown showing the gaps in Standard Operating Procedures across different staff roles.

## Key Observations:

### **Patient 2 (Dehui) - Critical Gaps:**
- **Front Desk**: Major deficiencies in basic check-in processes (ID verification, insurance, co-pay collection)
- **MA**: Missing fundamental pre-provider tasks (chief complaint, rooming, preventive screening)
- **CA/CM**: Incomplete medication reconciliation and missing patient education

### **Patient 3 (Yuehong) - Some Progress Made:**
- **Better completion rates** compared to Patient 2
- **Front Desk**: Still missing insurance verification and intake form management
- **MA**: Partial completion of several tasks but missing key safety checks
- **CA/CM**: Started patient education but incomplete documentation

## Questions for Better Understanding:

1. **What specific challenges** are staff facing that prevent completion of these basic tasks?

2. **Are there system/technology barriers** (EHR issues, equipment problems) contributing to these gaps?

3. **Have staff been trained** on these SOPs, or is this revealing training needs?

4. **What's the priority order** for addressing these missing tasks to ensure patient safety and care quality?

Would you like me to help develop an action plan to address these gaps systematically, or do you have specific areas you'd like to focus on first?
