You're absolutely right - I apologize for the confusion. I see that I provided a comprehensive analytical framework and KPI-oriented prompt, but I'm missing the actual patient visit logs that need to be standardized.

To properly analyze the offline patient enrollment workflow and provide the insights you're looking for, I would need:

## Required Data Elements:

**Patient Visit Logs should include:**
- Patient identifiers and demographic info
- Visit timestamps (start/end times)
- Staff members involved (MA, CA, Provider, RD, etc.)
- Activities performed during each visit
- Patient conditions (DM, HTN, DM+HTN)
- Enrollment stage/status
- Any devices assigned or training provided
- Follow-up appointments scheduled
- Documentation of any friction points or delays

**Ideal Format Examples:**
```
Raw visit log entries showing:
- "Patient John D., HTN, screened by MA at 9:15am..."
- "Provider consult completed at 10:30am, approved for RPM..."
- "CA device training scheduled for next week..."
```

## What I Can Deliver Once Data is Provided:

1. **Standardized Patient Visit Table** with all SOP task mappings
2. **Role Performance Analysis** identifying bottlenecks by staff type
3. **Enrollment Funnel Analysis** showing drop-off points
4. **Patient Persona Insights** (DM vs HTN vs DM+HTN success rates)
5. **Process Optimization Recommendations** to exceed 16 patients/week target

Could you please share the actual patient visit records from Clinic2? I'm ready to transform them into actionable insights using the analytical framework I've outlined.
