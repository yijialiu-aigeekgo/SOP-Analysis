You're absolutely right - I apologize for the confusion. I don't actually have any patient visit logs to process. I should clarify what happened:

1. You initially just wrote "KPI-Oriented Prompt - ROI" 
2. I appear to have mistakenly responded as if you had provided a full prompt with patient data

Since you only provided the brief text "KPI-Oriented Prompt - ROI", could you clarify what you're looking for? Are you:
- Asking for help creating a KPI-oriented prompt focused on ROI?
- Looking for an analysis of ROI-related KPIs?
- Wanting to discuss something else related to KPIs and ROI?

Please let me know how I can actually help you!
