| **Overall** | **10** | **8.5** | **85%** |

### 3. Resource Utilization
- **MA Workload:** 8 distinct tasks + 1 extra (EKG)
- **CA/CM Engagement:** Minimal (1 partial task)
- **Front Desk Utilization:** 0% (MA covered)

## Financial Impact Analysis

### Revenue Considerations
- **New Patient Visit (99204):** ~$200-250
- **EKG (93000):** ~$50
- **Potential UC Program Enrollment:** $50-100/month ongoing

### Cost Drivers
- **Extended Wait Time Cost:** 22 mins √ó $0.50/min overhead = $11 loss
- **MA Overtime Risk:** 18 mins in vital room (50% over target)
- **Underutilized CA/CM:** Opportunity cost ~$25/visit

## ROI Opportunities

### Immediate Actions (Quick Wins)
1. **Reduce Lobby Wait** 
   - ROI: Save 12 mins = $6/patient √ó 20 patients/day = $120/day
   - Implementation: Pre-visit form completion online

2. **Optimize MA Workflow**
   - ROI: Reduce vital room time by 6 mins = 1 extra patient/day = $200 revenue
   - Implementation: Delegate UC education to CA/CM

### Strategic Improvements
1. **UC Program Enrollment**
   - Current: Partial explanation only
   - Potential: Full enrollment = $600/year recurring revenue per patient
   - Action: Dedicated CA/CM engagement

2. **Task Redistribution**
   - Move 30% of MA tasks to support staff
   - Capacity gain: 2-3 additional patients/day = $400-600 revenue

# KPI-Oriented Analysis: Patient Visit P3 Yuehong

## Executive Summary
**Visit Duration:** 40+ minutes (incomplete record)  
**Visit Type:** New patient with DM/HTN - medication refill  
**Key Finding:** Significant operational inefficiencies in check-in process resulting in 22-minute lobby wait time

## ROI Impact Analysis

### 1. Time Utilization Metrics

**Check-In Phase Performance:**
- **Total Duration:** 24 minutes (2:58-3:22)
- **Value-Added Time:** 2 minutes (check-in) + 18 minutes (clinical tasks) = 20 minutes
- **Non-Value Added Time:** 22 minutes (lobby wait)
- **Efficiency Rate:** 47.6% (20/42 minutes of recorded time)

**Cost Impact:**
- MA idle time during 22-minute wait = $11 opportunity cost (assuming $30/hour MA rate)
- Patient satisfaction risk from extended wait time
- Potential downstream delays for subsequent appointments

### 2. Staff Productivity KPIs

**MA Performance:**
- Tasks Completed: 7 SOP tasks + 1 extra task (EKG)
- Multi-tasking efficiency: Combined check-in and clinical duties
- **Gap:** No handoff to dedicated front desk staff for check-in

**Role Optimization Issues:**
- MA performing front desk duties (role duplication)
- UC tasks initiated but completion unclear
- No provider interaction documented

### 3. Process Bottleneck Analysis

**Critical Bottleneck:** New patient paperwork processing
- 22-minute form completion time (3x industry standard of 7-10 minutes)
- Required family assistance suggests form complexity or language barrier
- Manual medication transcription from boxes indicates inefficient process

### 4. Revenue Optimization Opportunities

**Immediate ROI Actions:**

1. **Digital Intake Implementation**
   - Potential time savings: 15 minutes per new patient
   - Annual impact (200 new patients): 50 hours saved = $1,500 MA cost savings
   - Improved patient throughput: +1 patient/day capacity = $36,500 annual revenue potential

2. **Workflow Redistribution**
   - Dedicate front desk for check-in: Reduce MA non-clinical time by 30%
   - Implement parallel processing: Start vitals while completing forms
   - Expected efficiency gain: 20% reduction in total visit time

3. **UC Program Integration**
   - Incomplete device setup/education noted
   - Potential monthly recurring revenue: $50-100/patient for remote monitoring
   - P3 opportunity: $600-1,200 annual recurring revenue

## Recommended KPI Targets

1. **New Patient Check-in:** Reduce from 24 to 12 minutes (50% reduction)
2. **Lobby Wait Time:** Maximum 10 minutes (55% reduction)
3. **MA Clinical Efficiency:** Increase clinical task time from 47.6% to 75%
4. **UC Program Enrollment:** Complete setup during initial visit (100% completion rate)

## Financial Impact Summary

**Annual ROI Projection (based on 200 new patients/year):**
- Labor cost savings: $1,500
- Increased capacity revenue: $36,500
- UC program revenue (50% enrollment): $60,000-120,000
- **Total Potential ROI: $98,000-158,000**

**Investment Required:**
- Digital intake system: $5,000-10,000
- Staff training: 20 hours
