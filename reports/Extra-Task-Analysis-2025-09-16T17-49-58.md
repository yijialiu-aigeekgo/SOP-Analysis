# Patient Visit ROI Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
**Patient:** P3 Yuehong | **Visit Type:** New Patient | **Conditions:** DM/HTN | **Visit Duration:** 40+ minutes

## Time & Resource Utilization Analysis

### Staff Time Investment
| Role | Tasks Performed | Time Allocated | Cost Impact* |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **MA** | 8 tasks (7 SOP + 1 Extra) | ~22 mins | $11-17 |
| **CA/CM** | 1 task (Patient Education) | ~5 mins | $3-5 |
| **Front Desk** | 0 tasks (MA covered) | 0 mins | $0 |

*Estimated at $30-45/hour for MA, $35-55/hour for CA/CM

### Patient Wait Time Analysis
- **Lobby Wait:** 22 minutes (59% of tracked visit time)
- **Active Care Time:** 18 minutes (41% of tracked visit time)
- **Wait-to-Care Ratio:** 1.22:1 (inefficient)

## Efficiency Metrics

### Task Consolidation Opportunities
1. **Role Overlap:** MA performed front desk duties (check-in) - potential $5-8 savings if properly allocated
2. **Multi-tasking in Vital Room:** 7 distinct tasks in 18 minutes = 2.6 mins/task average
3. **Documentation Burden:** Multiple form completions requiring patient/relative assistance

### Process Bottlenecks Identified
- **Extended lobby wait** (22 mins) despite 3:00 PM appointment
- **Manual medication transcription** from boxes to forms
- **Duplicate data collection** (forms + verbal in vital room)

## ROI Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Quick Wins)
1. **Pre-visit digital forms** - Save 15-20 mins lobby time
2. **Dedicated check-in staff** - Free MA for clinical tasks
3. **Medication photo capture** - Replace manual transcription

### Revenue Enhancement Opportunities
| Action | Potential Annual Impact |
|--------|------------------------|
| Reduce wait time by 50% | +2-3 patients/day capacity |
| Proper role utilization | -15% labor cost per visit |
| Digital intake implementation | -$3-5/visit in admin costs |

### Quality & Compliance Risks
- **Incomplete checklists** noted across multiple tasks
- **MA performing outside scope** (front desk duties)
- **Extended wait impacting patient satisfaction scores**

## Key Performance Indicators

### Current State
- **Patient Flow Efficiency:** 41%
- **Staff Utilization Rate:** ~70% (role mixing)
- **First Visit Completion Time:** 40+ minutes

### Target State (6-month goal)
- **Patient Flow Efficiency:** 65%
- **Staff Utilization Rate:** 90%
- **First Visit Completion Time:** 30 minutes

## Financial Impact Summary

**Annual Projected Savings (250 working days):**
- Improved efficiency: $15,000-20,000
- Increased capacity: $30,000-45,000 (2 extra patients/day)
- Reduced overtime: $8,000-12,000

**Total ROI Potential:** $53,000-77,000 annually

## Action Priority Matrix
1. **High Impact/Low Effort:** Digital forms, medication photo capture
2. **High Impact/High Effort:** Staff role realignment, scheduling optimization
3. **Monitor:** UC device program enrollment, EKG necessity for routine visits
