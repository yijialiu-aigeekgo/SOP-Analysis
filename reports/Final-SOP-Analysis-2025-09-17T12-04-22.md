# Final SOP Analysis Report

**Generated:** 2025-09-17T12:04:22.812Z
**Report Type:** Final-SOP-Analysis

---

Based on the provided clinic visit log for Patient P3 Yuehong, I'll analyze the workflow and create a standardized table. However, I must note that this appears to be data for only ONE patient, which limits my ability to calculate averages across multiple patients.

## Patient Categorization

**Patient P3 Yuehong**: iHealth Enrollment (new patient to both clinic and iHealth program, with UC diabetes management discussion)

## Duration Calculation Methodology

**Available Duration Data from Source:**
- Patient Registration at Front Desk: 2 minutes (explicitly stated)
- Intake Forms Management in Lobby: 22 minutes (explicitly stated)
- Vital Room activities: 18 minutes (explicitly stated)

**Note:** Since this is only one patient's data, I cannot calculate averages. I will present the actual recorded durations for this single patient.

## iHealth Enrollment Workflow Table (Based on P3 Yuehong)

| Location | Role | SOP Task | Task Code | Duration |
|----------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Front Desk | MA | Patient Registration<br>- Confirmed appointment<br>- Recorded arrival time<br>- Marked patient as "Arrived" | CI.1 | 2 mins (single patient data) |
| Lobby | Patient | Intake Forms Management<br>- Completed new patient forms<br>- Listed medications<br>- Signed forms | CI.3 | 22 mins (single patient data) |
| Lobby | MA | Demographics Update<br>- Verified pharmacy<br>- Collected ID<br>- Scanned insurance card<br>- Obtained email | CI.2 | Not specified |
| Vital Room | MA | 1) Rooming - Called patient from lobby<br>2) Standard Vitals Collection - BP, oxygen, temp, weight, height<br>3) Medication Reconciliation - Reviewed med bottles, entered in IMS, confirmed allergies<br>4) Chief Complaint Capture - Documented reason (refill meds, left leg pain)<br>5) History Taking - Family history, dietary habits, substance use, living situation, exercise, travel history | PP.1, PP.2, PP.3, PP.4, PP.5 | Combined total: 18 mins (single patient data)<br>- Individual task durations not specified |
| Vital Room | MA | EKG Performance (Extra task) | - | Included in 18 mins above |
| Vital Room | CA/CM | Patient Education (Condition Basics)<br>- Asked about home devices<br>- Explained UC diabetes management program | UC.1 | Included in 18 mins above |

## Key Observations

1. **Data Limitations**: This analysis is based on a single patient visit. Calculating averages would require multiple patient records for statistical validity.

2. **Duration Gaps**: 
   - Demographics Update task has no specified duration
   - Individual task durations within the 18-minute Vital Room period are not broken down
   - Cannot determine specific time allocation for UC program discussion

3. **Workflow Characteristics for iHealth Enrollment**:
   - Involves extended lobby time for new patient paperwork (22 mins)
   - Includes comprehensive vital room activities combining clinical tasks with UC program introduction
   - MA performed most tasks with CA/CM involvement for UC education

4. **Total Visit Time (Tracked Activities)**:
   - Front Desk to Vital Room completion: 42 minutes of documented activities
   - Additional provider visit time not included in this record

**Note:** To create reliable average durations and identify consistent workflow patterns, additional patient visit records would be needed for each scenario type (iHealth Enrollment, iHealth Follow-Up, and Non-iHealth visits).
