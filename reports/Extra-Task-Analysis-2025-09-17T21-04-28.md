# Scenario-Based Extra Task Analysis

## Patient Distribution by Scenario

### Scenario 1: UC Enrollment (Initial Visit)
**Patient Count:** 1
**Patients:** 
- P3 Yuehong (Clinic's new patient; iHealth new patient)

**Categorization Rationale:** Patient explicitly identified as both clinic new patient and iHealth new patient, indicating initial enrollment in the iHealth chronic disease management program.

## Scenario 1: UC Enrollment (Initial Visit) - Extra Task Analysis

| Phase | Primary Role | Extra Task Name | Frequency | Average Duration | SOP Potential | Patient Cases |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Pre-Provider Workflow | MA | EKG Performance | 1 | Not specified | Yes | P3 Yuehong: EKG performed during vital signs collection for new patient with DM/HTN diagnosis. Provides baseline cardiac assessment for chronic disease management enrollment. |

### Quantitative Summary
- **Total extra tasks identified:** 1
- **Distribution by phase:** Pre-Provider Workflow (1 task)
- **Distribution by role:** MA (1 task)
- **Time impact:** Unable to calculate due to lack of duration data

### Qualitative Assessment

#### High-Value Tasks
- **EKG Performance:** Critical baseline assessment for patients with DM/HTN enrolling in chronic disease management. Should be incorporated into standard UC enrollment protocol.

#### Low-Value Tasks
- None identified

#### Standardization Opportunities
1. **UC Enrollment Protocol Enhancement:** Incorporate EKG as standard procedure for all new iHealth patients with cardiovascular risk factors (DM/HTN)
2. **Time Allocation:** Allocate additional 5-10 minutes for vital room procedures during initial visits to accommodate baseline assessments

### Operational Impact Analysis

#### Efficiency Gains
- Minimal inefficiencies identified; the single extra task adds clinical value

#### Resource Optimization
- Consider training all MAs on EKG performance to ensure consistent availability for new patient enrollments
- Ensure EKG equipment is readily accessible in vital rooms

#### ROI Implications
- Baseline EKG documentation supports:
  - Better risk stratification for chronic disease management
  - Potential early detection of cardiac complications
  - Enhanced care quality metrics for value-based contracts

## Scenarios 2-4: Data Not Available

**Note:** The provided patient record only contains information for one patient (P3 Yuehong), representing a UC Enrollment scenario. Analysis for the following scenarios cannot be completed without additional patient data:
- Scenario 2: In-Clinic Follow-Up
- Scenario 3: Annual Visit  
- Scenario 4: Non-iHealth Patient Visit

## Cross-Scenario Analysis and Recommendations

### Key Findings
1. **Limited Extra Task Burden:** Only one extra task identified in the available data, suggesting either:
   - Efficient adherence to existing SOPs
   - Potential underreporting of activities
   - Need for more comprehensive time-motion data collection

2. **Clinical Value of Extra Tasks:** The identified EKG performance represents high clinical value rather than operational inefficiency

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Standardize EKG Protocol:** Develop written protocol for EKG performance during UC enrollment visits
2. **Staff Training:** Ensure all MAs are certified in EKG administration and interpretation basics

#### Future Analysis Needs
1. **Expand Data Collection:** Gather complete visit records for all four scenario types to enable comprehensive analysis
2. **Duration Tracking:** Implement systematic time tracking for all extra tasks to quantify operational impact
3. **Outcome Correlation:** Link extra task performance with clinical outcomes to validate value proposition

#### Protocol Development Priorities
1. **UC Enrollment Checklist:** Create comprehensive checklist incorporating baseline assessments like EKG
2. **Role Clarity:** Define clear boundaries between MA, CA, and CM responsibilities during enrollment
3. **Documentation Standards:** Establish clear documentation requirements for extra tasks to support billing and quality reporting

### Limitations of Current Analysis
- Single patient sample limits generalizability
- Absence of duration data prevents ROI calculation
- Unable to compare efficiency across different visit scenarios
- Cannot identify patterns or trends with n=1

### Next Steps
1. Collect minimum 10 patient records per scenario type
2. Implement systematic extra task tracking with duration capture
3. Conduct follow-up analysis with complete dataset
4. Develop scenario-specific workflow optimization plans based on findings

### Extra Task Analysis Table

| Phase | Primary Role | Extra Task Name | Frequency | Average Duration | SOP Potential | Patient Cases |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Pre-Provider Workflow | MA | EKG Performance | 1 | Not specified | Yes | P3 Yuehong: EKG performed during vital signs collection as part of initial cardiovascular assessment for new DM/HTN patient |

### Quantitative Summary
- **Total extra tasks identified:** 1
- **Distribution by phase:** Pre-Provider Workflow (1)
- **Distribution by role:** MA (1)
- **Time impact:** Unable to calculate due to lack of duration data

### Qualitative Assessment

**High-Value Tasks:**
- EKG Performance: Critical baseline cardiovascular assessment for new DM/HTN patient enrollment, should be standardized for all initial UC enrollment visits

**Low-Value Tasks:**
- None identified

**Standardization Opportunities:**
- Incorporate EKG as standard protocol for all new UC enrollment patients with cardiovascular risk factors (DM/HTN)
- Define clear criteria for when EKG should be performed during initial visits

### Operational Impact Analysis

**Efficiency Gains:**
- Standardizing EKG protocol would eliminate uncertainty and reduce time spent on clinical decision-making

**Resource Optimization:**
- Training all MAs on EKG performance for initial visits would improve workflow flexibility

**ROI Implications:**
- Early cardiovascular screening through standardized EKG protocol could improve long-term patient outcomes and reduce emergency interventions

## Scenario 2: In-Clinic Follow-Up
*No data available for analysis*

## Scenario 3: Annual Visit
